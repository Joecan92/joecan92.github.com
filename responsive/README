I tried to do this with the iPhone 4, so I set the max-device-width to 960px.
This will cause all devices with device-width less than 960px to have only
"Dice" shown. So the iPhone 4 will have only "Dice" shown. The wording of the
lab slightly confused me because it says "when loaded on a device of your
choosing", so I'm assuming it is supposed to work on the device of our
choosing and any device smaller than our chosen device. If this is not the
case (that is, if smaller devices should also display "No dice", then the 
index.html file would have to be changed from max-device-width: to
device-width:. I didn't make this change because the way the lab was 
described in class made it sound like it was suppose to behave like the 
example shown in class.
