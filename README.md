1. I believe all aspects of the assignment have been implemented properly.
I have created all three files and I think they behave as specified.

2. I have not collaborated with anyone on this assignment. However,I would like
to note that I took this course 2 years ago and dropped it. Thus I used material
I wrote from when I was in the class before. However I edited all the
material.

3. I spent approximately 5 hours on this assignment, but I was working on it
while doing other stuff (like I wasn't focused on the assignment 100% of the
time). Also a lot of the time was trying to figure out github.
